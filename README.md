## Project Design 
This project introduces a lightweight, real-time computer vision pipeline for quantifying human attention during advertisement engagement.

It has three main stages: 
1. Person Detection and Identification
2. Head Pose Estimation
3. Gaze Tracking


## Project Structure
- MAIN branch: Integration of the Person Detection and Gaze Tracking stages can be found on the main branch.
- submission/... branches: These branches store the final code used in each stage of our algorithm. 


## TIMELINE

#### Tuesday Week 10: 
- Data collection
- Defined layout of assignment + what data is needed for each section

#### Friday Week 10: 
- Simple per photo pipeline, NOT integrated
- Each module working for simple photos

#### Friday Week 11: 
- Video working for Subject Detection + V1 of integration

#### Tuesday Week 12: 
- Try integrate Video for Face + Eye detection (working on single image within video pipeline)

#### Wednesday Week 12:
